<p class="ChapterTitle">Introduction</p>
<p class="noindent">Since its release, Arduino has become more than just a development platform; it has become a culture built around the idea of open source and open hardware, and one that is reimagining computer science and education. Arduino has opened hardware development by making the starting skills easy to obtain, but retaining the complexities of real-world application. This combination makes Arduino a perfect environment for school students, seasoned developers, and designers. This is the first Arduino book to hold the title of &#x201C;Pro,&#x201D; and demonstrates skills and concepts that are used by developers in a more advanced setting. Going beyond projects, this book provides examples that demonstrate concepts that can be easily integrated into many different projects and provide inspiration for future ones. The focus of this book is as a transition from the intermediate to the professional.</p>
